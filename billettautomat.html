	<!--Tekst til siden-->
	<p>The e-ticket vending machines are placed in a crowded room inside the central station building.<br>
	<br>
	There are informational screens and many ticket vending machines to choose from, in addition to an information desk. The user has to choose where to look, where to go, and which machine they should use to buy their ticket.<br>
	<br>
	After choosing the e-ticket machine, the user has to figure out how it works, buy a ticket and then catch their train in time for departure.<br>
	<br>
	There is a lot of noise from other people, loudspeakers, escalators and passing trains. This can make the user unfocused, and make it harder to acknowledge important information.<br>
	<br>
	Most of the travelers on the airport express train carry some amounts of luggage they have to keep an eye on during the process of buying their ticket. This can be a trigger for stress and distract the user from the task they are doing. They are prevented from reading a lot of text due to the distractions they are facing.<br></p>

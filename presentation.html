	<strong>Security</strong><br>
	First, there is many security issues. You want to be reassured that you can buy your ticket in a safe way. How safe is the e-ticket vending machine? Many people are skeptical regarding security, mainly because you don’t have to press your pin code. They may end up choosing the traditional ticket machine, even though it is more complicated and more time-consuming. Other than the security regarding your pin code, you have other important questions, like what happens if the magnetic stripe on my card doesn’t work, or what happens if I swipe my card twice? <br><br>


	<strong>Ticket types</strong><br>
	The e-ticket vending machine appears to give you only one ticket choice, one adult one-way-ticket to Oslo Airport Gardermoen. This would be perfect for an adult travelling alone, but what if you are not?<br>
	The concept of the machine is that it’s fast, and we would like to keep it that way. At the same time, we want to reach out to more people and make it more usable. We would like to add more ticket options, like for a student, senior or a child. If you don’t want to pay the price of an adult ticket, you have to register your card on their website (flytoget.no) before you go, and plot in if you are a student or a senior. This is inconvenient for the user, and difficult to know beforehand. <br>

	A solution to this problem could be an opportunity to choose if you are a student or a senior before you swipe your card. An easier way of doing that, could be that the machine reads your card and are able to tell how old you are, or if you are a student, and then decide which ticket to give you. <br><br>

	Other problems with the e-ticket vending machine is that it doesn’t tell you how you can buy more than one ticket. If you want to buy more than one ticket you have to use the regular ticket machine. <br><br>

	<strong>Application</strong><br>
	The airport express train already has an application for smartphone, where you have all the information about train schedules, ticket prices and other information. The disadvantage of this application is that you can’t buy an e-ticket. Most of the Norwegian population owns a smartphone, and a lot of them use applications for transportation tickets. <a href="http://www.dn.no/nyheter/naringsliv/2014/12/22/2204/Samferdsel/app-med-napp-hos-reisende">Source: Dagens Næringsliv</a><br> “Flytoget” should upgrade their application, so one could buy an e-ticket directly from their smartphone in the environment of their own choice.<br><br>

	<strong>Payment</strong><br>
	We would also like to put in more options for the payment. Now you can only pay with your magnetic stripe, and if that doesn’t work you would like to use your chip or the new NFC-payment solution on you credit card. Another method is of course to pay with your phone, via the application. <br><br>

	<strong>Video demonstrations </strong><br>
	The ticket vending machine should have a video demonstration of how to use the machine, to make it easier for the passenger. At Oslo central station they have several screens, which shows when the trains leave. In addition to having video demonstrations on the ticket machines, they should show some of the videos on the big screens. In this way, the user can watch the videos while they wait in line. <br><br>

	<strong>Screen</strong><br>
	The screen of the e-ticket machine gives you very little information and for a person with reduced capabilities, it could be a problem. We suggest a clearer sign that your payment is accepted and you can board the train. We would like it to be a green round figure on the screen, that says “GO” with large text. Then you easily know that you can board the train. If something goes wrong and the ticket is not ready, then there could be a large red “stop-sign”. <br><br>


	<strong>Other??</strong><br>
	The average user is also under time pressure, they are often in a hurry to catch the earliest train possible to get to the airport in time for their plane departure.<br><br>

	Some users can experience troubles with screen glare on the screens, due to a massive amount of lights placed in the ceiling over the screens, which are facing upwards on the e-ticket vending machines.
